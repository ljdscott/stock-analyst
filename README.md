**Stock Analysis**

      The purpose of this project is to become familiar with advanced Excel features such as VBA and
the use of button. Using these features, stock market data from 2017 and 2018 was analyzed to determined 
annual rate of return and Volume loss or growth. Code was written to provide headers for the added 
worksheets, retrieve data from another worksheet, use mathematical functions using code, color code 
output data and create buttons. 

**Results**  

	There is a stark difference in the data from 2017 to 2018. Year 2017 seems to be very profitable 
with 10 out 11 Tickers remain with a positive Return the positive for the year. By comparison, in 2018,
 most Tickers or stocks had drastically decreased with significant losses. In 2018 7 out of 11 Stocks/ Tickers 
has double digit loses with the most significant loses are DQ (-62.6%), FSLR (-39.7%), JKS (-60.5%), and 
SPWR (-44.6%). By comparison, in 2017 one stock/ Ticker had showed some loss, TERP at -7.2%. The execution
 time of the original and refractory scrip could not be determined. 
 


**Summary** 

Refactoring code can be a simplified easier to read version of the main code, helps find bugs and decreases
 programming time. A disadvantage is it could also be time consuming, making processing times unpredictable. 
The challenge sample code could not be accessed; its effect on VBA code could not be determined in this analysis.
